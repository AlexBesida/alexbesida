## &nbsp;&nbsp; — 🥳 Hey there! My name is &nbsp;🔦 Oleksii
- Usually I define myself as an `📺 Interface Designer`.
- You will typically find me spending hours on creating 𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎 🪄 𝑈𝐼 𝑒𝑓𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡𝑠 and making sure blend modes look 𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑓𝑒𝑐𝑡 ✨.
- If you ask me, I love designing 📱 _mobile_ and 🖥️ _web_ applications the most.
- You can check some of my latest works on [**Layers**](https://layers.to/olksij) 🎨

### &nbsp;&nbsp; — 🏖️ When I'm out of work
- sometimes I tend play in `🎞️ Flutter`,
- ...this is how I usually make my designs 𝑐𝑜𝑚𝑒 𝑡𝑜 𝑙𝑖𝑓𝑒 🏃, and thats the place I experiment with 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑠 ✋ the most. 

### &nbsp;&nbsp; — 🛋️ Aside from that,
- you can also find me playing with `🧊 GLSL` shaders,
- or experimenting with `Dart`, `C++`, or `Python` for simple 📜 𝑠𝑐𝑟𝑖𝑝𝑡𝑖𝑛𝑔.
- In the past, I would tinker with `🌐 Typescript` and `🪟 UWP` stuff as well.

|---|---|---|
|🌸 [`phalaenopsis`](https://github.com/olksij/phalaenopsis)|A past future version of [olek.si](https://olek.si)|This repository has a Typescript code I am most proud ✨ of. The project had a custom-dom parser that generated a skeleton tree, and a morphing engine that morphed the skeleton into text.|
|🕯️ [`candlewax`](https://github.com/olksij/skribo.link)|The current (old) implementation of [skribo.link](https://skribo.link)|This is a complete sideproject that was my first intention to make a communication between people more thoughtful 💌, though I made it in a less than a month, based on my experience now I am creating `ceramic` ⚡️|
|🪨 [`slate`](https://github.com/olksij/olek.si)|The current implementation of [olek.si](https://olek.si)|A a simple Typescript website (`orchid`) with a loader inherited from `phalaenopsis`. It still has some nice code.|
|🍽️ `ceramic`|The work in progress version of `Skribo` I am excited about 😻|A happiness-sharing app I am developing (for a long time), which is a place for a number of meaningful interactions possible between people. You may see updates of it on my [𝕏](https://x.com/oleksiibe) or [Layers](https://layers.to/olksij) 😁|
